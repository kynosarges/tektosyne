/**
 * Provides algorithms to find all intersections between multiple line segments.
 * Provides two algorithms to find all intersections between multiple line segments,
 * specified as arrays of {@link LineD} instances:
 * <ul><li><p>
 * {@link MultiLineIntersection#find} provides a sweep line algorithm which is very
 * efficient if the number of intersections is much smaller than the number of lines.
 * </p></li><li><p>
 * {@link MultiLineIntersection#findSimple} provides a brute force algorithm which is
 * better suited for a small number of lines or a large number of intersections.
 * </p></li></ul>
 * Both algorithms sort their results lexicographically on the points of intersection, first
 * by increasing y-coordinates and then, in case of equality, by increasing x-coordinates.
 * The {@link MultiLinePoint} instance created for each point identifies all line segments
 * that contain the point. Please refer to the two methods for further details.
 * <p>
 * The sweep line algorithm implemented by {@link MultiLineIntersection#find} was first
 * described by J. L. Bentley and T. A. Ottmann, <em>Algorithms for reporting and counting
 * geometric intersections</em>, IEEE Transactions on Computers C-28 (1979), p.643-647.
 * An implementation outline is given by Mark de Berg et al., <em>Computational Geometry</em>
 * (3rd ed.), Springer-Verlag 2008, p.20-29, and a limited C++ implementation by Michael J. Laszlo,
 * <em>Computational Geometry and Computer Graphics in C++</em>, Prentice Hall 1996, p.173-181.</p>
 * <p>
 * Our implementation supports an unlimited number of line segments meeting at any intersection
 * point, and uses an improved sweep line comparer that raises the algorithm’s stability to the
 * same level as that of the brute force algorithm. A comment block at the top of the source code
 * file gives a detailed description of this comparer.</p>

     * The Sweep Line Comparer (Status.compareLines)
     * ---------------------------------------------
     * A critical point in the sweep line algorithm is the design of the comparison function that
     * determines the order of line segments currently intersecting the moving sweep line. The
     * straightforward approach is to compute the intersection points and first order by those,
     * and then by line slopes when multiple lines intersect the sweep line at the same point.
     *
     * This approach has the obvious weakness that the "same" point is hard to identify, given the
     * precision limits of floating-point computation. Should the comparison method fail to sort
     * line segments correctly and consistently, the sweep line structure will become corrupted
     * and the algorithm will fail to output all intersections. One could use a comparison epsilon,
     * but that creates the risk of false positives when lines are near but do not (yet) cross.
     *
     * Laszlo’s solution is to compare line segments not on the sweep line itself, but slightly
     * above or below the sweep line. With an appropriate delta, the test point is never close to
     * an intersection and directly provides a consistent ordering. However, this method is also
     * susceptible to data corruption if the chosen delta is too large for very close event points,
     * or else too small for very narrow intersection angles.
     *
     * Our implementation takes a different approach. At each event point, we first remove all
     * ending and intersecting lines from the sweep line structure, then compute the intersections
     * of all remaining lines with the current sweep line, and then add (back) all starting and
     * intersecting lines. The intersection points of (re-)added lines are <em>not</em> computed
     * but simply copy the current event point location. This permits the use of exact coordinate
     * comparisons to reliably identify line intersections. The order of intersecting lines is
     * determined by their slopes, as usual.
     *
     * Our implementation performs about as well as Laszlo’s approach, but it is far more stable.
     * Testing shows the same perfect stability as for the brute force algorithm, even with large
     * input coordinates that reliably cause data corruption in the Laszlo implementation. The
     * {@link MultiLineIntersection#find} method still checks for evidence of data corruption and
     * throws an {@link IllegalStateException} upon detection, but this should not happen in the
     * current implementation. (The corruption tests do not impact performance.)
